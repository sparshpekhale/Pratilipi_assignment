# Pratilipi Assignment
### By: Sparsh Pekhale

Chosen model - Used a collaborative filtering model instead of a content filtering model since newer books can be easily added in a collaborative filterting.

Requirements:
Run in google colab and "ds-assignment.zip" must be in google drive.

Model details:
Used tensorflow recommender library for easier implementation
Run for 10000 rows of data and few epochs due to google colab hardware limitations

Improvements:
Can include the genre feature also.
Can test out different model architectures and types of models.
